# Teamo-Challenge
My take on the ML and Data analytics challenge from TeamLift </br>
<hr>

## Technical Part
### Task 1: ER Diagram
Teamo AI compares user-submitted skill names to an administrator's list using various matching methods, returning results based on internal scores. </br>
The task includes drawing an ER diagram to design the database structure for Teamo AI, with entities such as User, Administrator, Skill, Query, and MatchResult, </br>
ensuring to store matching methods and scores, and defining relationships between these entities.
